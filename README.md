# ImmoScout24Scraper
A simple scraper to get data from Immobilienscout24.de

This is a simple scraper to get basic data (names, addresses, prices,	square,	number of rooms and links) 
from Immobilienscout24.de. I created it to get data for my term paper.
You will probably need to change user agent or use proxy to avoid blocking.

You are free to use this parser as you want.
